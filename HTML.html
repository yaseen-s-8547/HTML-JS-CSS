        <p><i><u><strong> bootstrap paradox is a temporal paradox that occurs when an event or piece of information is sent back in time</strong></u></i><br> becoming the cause of its own existence, creating a closed causal loop. In essence, it involves a situation where something has no apparent origin, existing in a loop where it causes itself. </p>
